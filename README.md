## Notes

1. The assignment is only from an Admin perspective, you donâ€™t need to create specific users and
   permissions for different types of users (I.e. manager, client, admin, etc.).
2. Please create fake data so you can play with the system you built and make sure everything is
   working as expected.
3. Even if 100% of the tasks are not completed the assignment is still accepted, we are looking to
   see how you think and work.

**Good luck!**
